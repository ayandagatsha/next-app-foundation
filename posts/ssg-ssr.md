It's magic, portal magic. I feel as thought the electric wires and 
metals mask this invisible portal magic and somehow, a select few groups
of people where able to see past reality and logically organize resources 
to build a computer. The computer is modelled after our own biological structure and operates like us, only without its own conciseness.  

Studying computer science is like studying the arts of magic to allow a developer 
to enter the minds of anyone using their URL and implant the purposefully designed
web app user experience in their memories, causing them to do something. Whether its buy/order something, or send a message to their friend that is in another country... the limits of programming are the boundaries of peoples' imagination.
<!-- **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data. -->
